//The Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm is used to search a graph data structure for a node that meets a set of criteria.
//It starts at the root of the graph and visits all nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.Traverse level-wise
//Breadth-First Traversal (or Search) for a graph is similar to the Breadth-First Traversal of a tree.The only catch here is, that, unlike trees:
//graphs may contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again. To avoid processing a node more than once, we divide the vertices into two categories:
//...Visited and
//...Not visited
//A boolean visited array is used to mark the visited vertices. For simplicity, it is assumed that all vertices are reachable from the starting vertex.
//BFS uses a queue data structure for traversal.
