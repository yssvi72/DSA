# DSA - Important Questions with C++ Solutions

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms - Important Questions** repository! üöÄ This collection is a carefully curated list of crucial questions covering a wide range of DSA topics, with solutions provided in C++.

## üåü Features

- **Curated Selection**: A handpicked collection of essential DSA questions to reinforce your understanding.

- **Clear C++ Solutions**: Each question comes with detailed solutions written in C++ to help you grasp the underlying concepts.

- **Visual Learning**: Visualizations and illustrations to make complex concepts more accessible.
## LEETCODE PATTERNS 
Preface
It is highly recommended to read chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 10 of Cracking The Coding Interview to familiarize yourself with the following data structures and their operations:

Arrays
Maps
Linked Lists
Queues
Heaps
Stacks
Trees
Graphs
In addition, you should have a good grasp on common algorithms such as:

Breadth-first search
Depth-first search
Binary search
Recursion
Notes
This pdf contains useful information for the built-in data structures in Java.

Other useful methods to know include substring(), toCharArray(), Math.max(), Math.min(), and Arrays.fill().

Question List
The entire question list can be found here: https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/.

In addition to viewing the question list, companies that have previously asked the question in the past 6 months (as of May 2021) will be listed. You can also use the checkboxes to mark which questions you've completed!

Solutions
Solutions written in Java can be found in the solutions branch.

Leetcode Discuss
Leetcode discuss is an amazing resource and features previous interview questions, as well as compensation and general career advice.

Tips to Consider
If input array is sorted then
    - Binary search
    - Two pointers

If asked for all permutations/subsets then
    - Backtracking

If given a tree then
    - DFS
    - BFS

If given a graph then
    - DFS
    - BFS

If given a linked list then
    - Two pointers

If recursion is banned then
    - Stack

If must solve in-place then
    - Swap corresponding values
    - Store one or more different values in the same pointer

If asked for maximum/minumum subarray/subset/options then
    - Dynamic programming

If asked for top/least K items then
    - Heap

If asked for common strings then
    - Map
    - Trie

Else
    - Map/Set for O(1) time & O(n) space
    - Sort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space
Suggestions
Think a question should/shouldn't be included? Wish there was another feature? Feel free to open an issue with your suggestion!
