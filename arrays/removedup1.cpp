Removing duplicate is a tedious task if the array is unsorted but it becomes a cakewalk if the array is already sorted:

  1....Naive Approach: (obvious approach)
      If the array is already sorted , the two consecutive position will have its duplicates 
      For eg: arr1[]={ 4,1,4,3,5,6,9,2}
      If we sort the arr1 we get={ 1,2,3,4,4,5,6,9} , now by looking at this we can say that 4 is repeated twice so delete it.
